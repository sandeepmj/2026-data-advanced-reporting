# **Command Line Basics for Macs**

These are some common command line commands used to navigate folders and keep projects organized. 

Focus on understanding what each one does. At some point, they become muscle memory.

## **Open Terminal**

Use Spotlight (Command \+ Space), type Terminal, press Enter. This launches the interface in which we use the command line commands

## **Where am I?**

**pwd**  
Shows your current location in the file system.

## **What’s in this folder**?

**ls**  
Lists files and folders in the current directory.

## **Move into a folder**

**cd folder-name**  
Changes your location to the specified folder.

## **Move out of folder & up one level**

**cd ..**  
Moves you out of the current folder into its parent folder.

## **Go to root directory**

**cd \~**  
Returns you to your home directory.

## **Create a new folder**

**mkdir folder-name**  
Creates a new directory.

**Tips**

* Avoid spaces in folder names. Use underscores or camelCase instead.  
* Use **pwd** often to avoid getting lost.  
* If you are lost, go home using **cd \~** and make your way from there.  
* If things get really messed up and confusing, close the window and restart the Terminal.
